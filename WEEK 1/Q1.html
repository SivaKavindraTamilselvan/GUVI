        <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. Over time, HTTP has evolved to meet the increasing demands of modern web applications. This blog compares HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, highlighting their features, differences, and how they impact web performance.</p>
        
        <h2>What is HTTP/1.1?</h2>
        <p>HTTP/1.1, introduced in 1997, became the backbone of the World Wide Web for nearly two decades. It provided features like persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and caching enhancements. However, as websites became more complex, limitations such as head-of-line blocking and the need for multiple connections became apparent.</p>

        <h2>What is HTTP/2?</h2>
        <p>HTTP/2, introduced in 2015, is a major revision of HTTP/1.1. It is designed to address the inefficiencies of HTTP/1.1 and optimize performance for modern web needs. HTTP/2 is binary instead of text-based and supports multiplexing, header compression, and server push.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Differences Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiplexing:</strong> HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection, eliminating head-of-line blocking. HTTP/1.1 processes requests sequentially.</li>
            <li><strong>Header Compression:</strong> HTTP/2 uses HPACK compression to reduce the size of HTTP headers, improving efficiency. HTTP/1.1 sends headers in plain text.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Protocol:</strong> HTTP/2 is binary, making it faster and less error-prone compared to HTTP/1.1’s text-based protocol.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Push:</strong> HTTP/2 enables servers to proactively send resources to clients, reducing latency. HTTP/1.1 lacks this feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Connection Management:</strong> HTTP/2 uses a single connection per origin, while HTTP/1.1 often requires multiple connections for parallel requests.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Performance Impact</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>HTTP/2 significantly improves page load times, especially for resource-heavy websites. Features like multiplexing and header compression reduce latency and network overhead, resulting in a smoother user experience.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While HTTP/1.1 served the web well for many years, HTTP/2 represents a significant leap forward in web performance and efficiency. If you’re building or maintaining modern web applications, adopting HTTP/2 can greatly enhance performance and user satisfaction.</p>
